# NETWORK-SNIFFER-COMPUTER-NETWORKS-PROJECT

A network sniffer is a tool that captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time. It can help network administrators to troubleshoot network issues, monitor bandwidth usage, and identify security threats. This project report discusses the implementation and usage of a network sniffer tool using Python programming language and Scapy library. The tool captures and analyzes network packets, extracts information such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, packet size, and payload data, and performs advanced analysis such as identifying network protocols and detecting network anomalies. The tool can also visualize network traffic using graphs and charts to help network administrators understand network traffic patterns and identify anomalies. The network sniffer tool is a powerful tool that can provide useful information for network administrators to optimize network performance and ensure network security.
